# Welcome to the RNADB Sequence Data WIKI

This repository houses the current raw (unprocessed) sequence data and metadata for the RNADB entries. The links in the side navigation provide organized sections of the documentation for this repository. We also have WIKI pages for the following (off-site) repositories related to RNADB:
* [GTFold Python Bindings](https://github.gatech.edu/gtDMMB/GTFoldPython/wiki) -- Used to call GTFold to evaluate numerical data related to the secondary structures of the sequence entries.
* [RNADB Construction Script](https://github.gatech.edu/gtDMMB/RNADB-construction/wiki) -- Python3 sources to generate the sequence entries in RNADA from the raw descriptions (CT/NOPCT/Papers) housed in this repository.
* [RNADB Reloaded](https://github.gatech.edu/gtDMMB/RNADB-reloaded/wiki) -- Web-based front and backend source code.

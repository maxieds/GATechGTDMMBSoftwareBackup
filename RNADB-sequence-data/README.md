# RNADB project sequence base data repository

## Where this project fits into the RNADB structure

We are separating implementation of scripts and web-app functionality here 
by creating this new repository to house the 
[RNADB](http://rnadb.gatech.edu) 
initial sequence data. 
We are able to search and parse the RNADB sequences (once they are inserted into the 
live MySQL databases) via the implementation in the 
[RNADB-reloaded repository](https://github.gatech.edu/mschmidt34/RNADB-reloaded). 
The python scripts to parse this sequence data into loadable CSV snippets within 
the web interface are found at the 
[rnadb-construction (updated fork) repository](https://github.gatech.edu/mschmidt34/RNADB-construction).
